# Stitches

The following are stitches that we will need to figure out how to encode,
in order of their approximate frequency or importance in machine knitting.
We could have a useful prototype even knowing just a handful of these.

Knit, purl, and possibly others have symbols that change depending on
the row number and pattern options.

Other stitches may be represented differently in hand knitting than in
machine knitting.

(If you add to this list, please try to find the appropriate symbols in
one of the Stitchmastery fonts so that Tom will know how best to represent the
stitches in Knitscheme.)

## Other machine knitting techniques?

There are other machine knitting techniques like weaving, thread lace,
plating, beading and so on. Whether these can be marked in DAK I don't
know. There are likely techniques that I am unaware of. Please make a
note of any that you might be interested in using.

## Hand knitting techniques

There are hand knitting techniques like entrelac, "bobble stitches", 
and so on that don't have equivalents in machine knitting. These are
a low priority, but please make a note of the ones that can be coded
in DAK.

## Pattern annotations

"Memos", placement of stitch markers, and other annotations can be
important features of a pattern. It may be possible to incorporate
some of these.
