We will need to do a series of experiments to reverse engineer the file format.

An experiment might be something like this:

* Create a small test pattern in DAK and record all the steps taken to make it,
so that it can be recreated exactly, as verified by e.g. an identical checksum.

* Make a small change to the pattern by varying one option or altering one stitch.

* Repeat until we have learned how these stitches are encoded under different pattern options.
