We will need to do a series of experiments to reverse engineer the file format.

An experiment might be something like, making a small test pattern in DAK and recording all the steps taken to make it,
so that it can be recreated exactly, i.e. has an identical checksum.

Make a small change to the pattern by varying one option or altering one stitch.

Repeat until we have learned how these stitches are encoded under different pattern options.
