A series of experiments will be required to reverse engineer the file format.

An experiment might proceed something like this:

* Create a small test pattern in DAK and record all the steps taken to make it
so that it can be recreated exactly.

* Make a small change to the pattern by varying one option or altering one stitch.

* Examine the contents of the `.stp` file to see how the contents have changed.

* Repeat until we have learned how these stitches are encoded under different pattern options.
