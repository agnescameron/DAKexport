Export DAK9 .stp files

Collaboration with [Agnes Cameron](https://github.com/agnescameron)

## Outline

The goal is to output knitting patterns as .stp files compatible with recent
versions of [Designaknit](https://softbyte.co.uk/).

For this to be useful it needs to be able to work with various different input
formats. I don't have firm suggestions how best to go about this. There are
various open source projects that have attempted to design open source pattern
formats. The most useful are Knitspeak and Knitout (see for example
